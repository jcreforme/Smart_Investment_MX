1. **Search Alerts**: The user provides criteria (e.g., Ticker) to search for matching alerts.
2. **Display Matches**: All matching alerts are displayed with their details (Ticker, Target Price, Status).
3. **Select Alert**: The user selects the alert they want to edit by entering its corresponding number.
4. **Update Target Price**: The user enters a new target price for the selected alert.
5. **Validation**: The method ensures the input is valid (e.g., within range, positive price).
6. **Save Changes**: The updated alert is saved back to the storage.

### Example Usage

#### Input:
```plaintext
Enter the criteria to search alerts (e.g., Ticker): AAPL
Matching Alerts:
1. Ticker: AAPL, Target Price: 200, Status: Active
Enter the number of the alert you want to edit (1-1): 1

### Save Alerts

The `save_alerts` method is responsible for persisting all alerts to a storage file. Here's how it works:

1. **Purpose**: Ensures that all alerts are saved to a file for future retrieval.
2. **File Format**: Alerts are stored in a CSV file format for easy readability and compatibility.
3. **Overwrite Behavior**: Each time the method is called, it overwrites the existing file with the latest alert data.
4. **Data Saved**: Each alert includes the following details:
   - Ticker
   - Target Price
   - Status (e.g., Active, Inactive)

### Example Usage

#### Code Example:
```ruby
# Example of saving alerts
alerts = [
  { ticker: "AAPL", target_price: 150, status: "Active" },
  { ticker: "GOOGL", target_price: 2800, status: "Inactive" }
]
```

#### OUTPUT
```plaintext
Ticker,Target Price,Status

GOOGL,2800,Inactive
```
